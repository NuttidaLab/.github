# NuttidaLab `.github` Repository

Welcome to the `.github` repository for NuttidaLab! This repository serves as a central location for storing community health files and templates that are used across our lab's GitHub repositories.

## Purpose

The `.github` repository is used to store files and templates that provide guidelines and expectations for contributors to our repositories. These files include:

- `workflows`: This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows that can be used across multiple repositories in our organization.
- `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` and `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE`: These directories contain templates for issues and pull requests, respectively, that are used when contributors create new issues or pull requests.
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: This file outlines the code of conduct for contributors to our projects.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: This file provides guidelines for contributing to our projects.
- `SECURITY.md`: This file outlines the security policies and procedures for our projects.

By including these files in the `.github` repository, we can ensure that contributors to our projects have a clear understanding of the expectations and guidelines for contributing, and that issues and pull requests are submitted in a consistent and organized manner.

## Usage

To use the files and templates stored in this repository, simply reference them in the appropriate repository. For example, to use the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in a new repository, simply copy it from the `.github` repository to the root directory of the new repository.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions to the `.github` repository from members of the NuttidaLab community. If you would like to suggest changes or additions to the files and templates in this repository, please open an issue or pull request.
